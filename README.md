# How to Play the Game


The purpose of the game is to test your memory and the amount of time it takes you to match all of the cards based on your memory.

You will:
  - Flip every card on the board
        The game will only show two flipped cards at a time. If the two cards match, they will stay displayed. If the cards do not match, they will flip back to a "no show" state

  - Remember where each icon is located when you flip each card. When you recognized a card while playing, you find the match for it.

  - Clear the board by matching all of the cards to win the game. A timer will start as soon as the game loads

  # An Added Bonus:
  You will receive stars based on the number of moves it took you to match all the cards. The fewer moves, the more stars!!! A move counts for each pair you try to match.

    - 	3 stars - is the  highest ratings as it took you less than 12 moves to clear the board.    

    - 	2 stars - it took you less than 24 moves to clear the board

    - 	1 stars - our lowest rating. Sorry, dude. Better Luck next time. At least you have one star. :)

# When you win the game, you get your stats

Once you match all the cards on the board, you get a popup detailing your stats
    - how many stars you received.
    - how long it took to match all the cards
    - how many moves it took to win the game.

You get to try again by pressing the Play Again button. You can press the reset button to reset the game at any time. Please remember when you do this, you will lose your stats!
